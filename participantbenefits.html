									<h3 class="major">Two Pension Plans</h3>
									<p>MPIPP collects contributions from entertainment production companies based upon the hours worked and the salaries earned by the covered union workers. These monies are then invested by outside
										fund managers engaged by MPIPP to guarantee that sufficient funds will be available to pay the monthly benefits when the participant retires or becomes disabled.</p>

									<p>Vested participants become eligible to receive retirement benefits from two different pension plans: the defined-benefit <strong>Basic Pension Plan (BPP)</strong> and the defined-contribution
										<strong>Individual Account Plan (IAP)</strong>.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Individual Account Plan (IAP)</h3>
									<p>The IAP is a defined contribution retirement plan that is tax deferred, like a 401(k). Usually, employees contribute a pre-tax fixed amount or a percentage of their paycheck to an individual
									account held in their name to fund their retirement. Unlike a typical 401(k) plan, the IAP at MPIPP is unique in that it is funded exclusively by employer contributions. The term defined-contributions
									plan alludes to the fact that only the formula for the contributions is known in advance and the actual amount of funding that will ultimately be available at retirement is uncertain since
									the rates of returns on IAP investment accounts are not predictable into the future.

									<p>Employers are required to contribute to the IAP based upon a percentage of the employees' compensation
									(approximately 6%). In the contribution forms, the amount is calculated by multiplying the salary times the IAP percentage rate. This yields the required IAP contribution.</p>

									<p><font size="5">Hours Worked * Scale = <strong>Salary Earned</strong></font></p>

									<p><font size="5">Salary Earned * IAP Percentage Rate = <strong>IAP Contribution</strong></font></p>

									<p>For example, a participant employee earning an hourly wage of $32.75 working 60 hours a week would earn $1965 as salary per the following calculation:
										<br /></br />
										60 * 32.75 = $1965.00
										<br /></br />
										As a result, the IAP contribution (per 6% contribution rate) would yield the following:
										<br /></br />
										$1965.00 * 0.06 = $117.90
										<br /></br />
										Once the IAP contribution is calculated for each employee, they are totaled to represent the total IAP contribution for a specific period.
										Once the amount due for BPP is also calculated, they will be added together to represent the total benefits.
									</p>

									<p>For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedbenefitpensionplan.asp" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Basic Pension Plan (BPP)</h3>
									<p>The BPP is a retirement plan where employee benefits are computed using a specified formula that considers factors such as length of employment, hours worked, and salary history.
									In defined-benefit plans, employees can calculate exactly what their future retirement payments will be, in advance, based upon their employment history before reaching the age of retirement.</p>

									<p>For calculating the BPP contribution, the total amount due for BPP is calculated by multiplying total number of hours worked by the employees during the period multiplied by the BPP rate
										($4.4130 in this case).</p>

									<p>For example, if the employees for the period have worked 120 hours total, the BPP total amount is calculated like the following:
										<br /></br />
										120 * $4.4130 = $529.56
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Total Benefits</h3>
									<p>The total amount due for IAP and BPP are added together for a specified period of time to represent the total benefits due.</p>
