									<h3 class="major">Running the Database</h3>
									<p>After launching the <em>MPIPP-Prototype.accdb</em> file, you will be greeted with the welcome page in pop-out view. Note that in this view you cannot click on anything other than the form. To exit the pop-out view, right-click anywhere on the form and select <em>Design View</em>.
									Now you are able to use the navigation menu on the left to open additional forms, queries, or tables to view/alter data in them. This is also how you can view changes made to the tables by the forms after the action is performed.</p>

									<p>To switch back to running the forms, make sure to switch back to <em>Form View</em>. Now you are able to interact with the forms, click buttons, and enter/view data in the text boxes.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Using the Database</h3>
									<p>The first step to using the database is to login as either a participant (employee who is receiving the benefits) or employer (production company). In addition to being able to register new
									participants and employers, there are also some that are pre-defined in the tables. You can view these entries by opening either the <em>ParticipantTable</em> or the <em>EmployerTable</em>.</p>

									<p>The tables contain the respective attributes and keys related to the entity. For example, to login as the user Alice, utilize the username <em>alice</em> and the password <em>alice</em>.
									Upon successful login, you are presented with the Participant/Employer profile page. Here you can edit profile, view benefits (feature pending), add beneficiaries (feature pending), etc.
									Editing the profile provides an opportunity to alter the default entries in the table with new ones. Once an edit is made and applied, the database prompts the user that they are about to make
								  a change to the table. Follow the prompts to ensure the changes are made. Once done, close and reopen the respective table to view the changes.</p>

									<p>Alternatively, the user can utilize the <em>Register</em> button to add a whole new participant/employer as a new record in the table. The process is very similar to the edit profile page.
									After the changes are made, verify that the new user/edited user is correct by logging in again and reviewing the attributes.</p>

									<h3 class="major">A Note on Security</h3>
									<p>Being a consulting firm, the security  posture of the database is of utmost important. As a result, so far we have implemented a number of features to increase the security posture of the database.
									So far, we have implemented input masks on the sensitive fields such as password and SSN fields so that the password is not visible as it is being typed and sensitive fields such as SSN are not open to
									any characters. other fields such as phone numbers and dates also automatically adjust to match the correct formatting as to not allow spontaneous values that can break the database. If typed wrong, a
									warning will ensure that the user corrects their mistake before submitting the form.</p>
